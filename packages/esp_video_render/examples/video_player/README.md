# Video Player Example

- Complex Example: ⭐⭐⭐

## Example Brief

- This example demonstrates how to build a lightweight video player on top of `esp_video_render`.
- It combines file-based media extraction, decode, render, and overlay UI into a single application flow.
- It shows how to play local media files with a compact on-screen UI that includes play state, progress, file name, volume, mute state, and FPS.

### Typical Scenarios

- Local video playback from SD card
- Media-first applications with lightweight UI
- Embedded demo player for MP4, AVI, or TS input
- Evaluating render, decode, and overlay interaction on ESP boards

### Resources

- Uses multiple worker tasks for extract, decode, and render/write stages
- Benefits from PSRAM for better buffering and decode throughput
- Embeds a font asset for the UI text layer

### Run Flow

The example scans `PLAYER_SOURCE_URL` for supported media files, builds a playlist, opens the first playable file, then runs the media pipeline and overlay UI in parallel.

    App->>Extractor: open media source
    Extractor-->>Decoder: compressed video frames
    Decoder-->>Render: decoded frames
    App->>OverlayUI: create status/progress widgets
    Render->>Render: display video stream
    OverlayUI->>Render: update overlay stream
```

## Environment Setup

### Hardware Required

- An ESP board with LCD support, such as:
  - [ESP32-S3-Korvo2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-adf/en/latest/design-guide/dev-boards/user-guide-esp32-s3-korvo-2.html)
  - [ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32p4/esp32-p4-function-ev-board/user_guide.html)
- A supported display panel
- An SD card

### Default IDF Branch

This example supports IDF release/v5.5 (>= v5.5.2).

### Software Requirements

- Put supported media files under `PLAYER_SOURCE_URL` from `main/settings.h`
- Default media directory:
  - `/sdcard/render`
- Supported file extensions discovered by the example:
  - `.mp4`
  - `.avi`
  - `.ts`

## Build and Flash

### Select and configure a development board

This example uses [ESP Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/esp-board-manager) to manage board-level resources. The [`esp-bmgr-assist`](https://pypi.org/project/esp-bmgr-assist/) helper tool is recommended as the default entry point.

Install once in your activated ESP-IDF Python environment:

```bash
pip install esp-bmgr-assist
pip install --upgrade esp-bmgr-assist  # run this command when an update is requested
```

- List supported boards:

```bash
idf.py bmgr -l
```

Example output:

```text
ℹ️  Board Components:
  espressif/esp_boards:
    [1] esp32_c3_lyra
    [2] esp32_lyrat_4_3
    [3] esp32_lyrat_mini_1_1
    [4] esp32_p4_eye
    [5] esp32_p4_function_ev_board
    [6] esp32_s31_function_coreboard_1
    [7] esp32_s31_korvo_1
    [8] esp32_s3_box_3
    [9] esp32_s3_box_lite
    [10] esp32_s3_korvo_2_3
    [11] esp32_s3_lcd_ev_board
    [12] esp_vocat_1_0
    [13] esp_vocat_1_2
```

The example output above is based on the board list and ordering from `esp_boards` 0.5.2. Different `esp_boards` versions or custom board dependencies may change the list and indexes. Use the actual output of `idf.py bmgr -l` when selecting a board.

- Select a board:

```bash
idf.py bmgr -b <board_index|board_name>
```

For example, to select `esp32_s3_korvo_2_3`:

```bash
idf.py bmgr -b 10
# or
idf.py bmgr -b esp32_s3_korvo_2_3
```

On first invocation, the component is downloaded automatically based on the `espressif/esp_board_manager` dependency declared in `main/idf_component.yml`.

> [!NOTE]
> To switch to a different board supported by `esp_board_manager`, repeat the same steps with the new board name or index.
> For a custom board, see [Creating a Board Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-board-manager/en/latest/create-board/index.html).
> For more information about `esp_board_manager`, see the [ESP Board Manager Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/espressif/esp-board-manager/blob/main/esp_board_manager/README.md).

### Project Configuration

Key settings are defined in `main/settings.h`:

- `PLAYER_SOURCE_URL`
- `PLAYER_DEFAULT_FPS`
- `PLAYER_EXTRACT_POOL_SIZE`
- `PLAYER_DEC_OUT_CACHE_SIZE`

The example also embeds `DejaVuSans.ttf` for the UI text layer.

### Build and Flash Commands

```bash
idf.py build
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

## How to Use the Example

### Functionality and Usage

- Copy one or more media files to `/sdcard/render`, or update `PLAYER_SOURCE_URL` to match your media directory.
- Flash the example and reset the board.
- The player starts automatically and opens the discovered playlist.
- The default runtime mode enables:
  - UI overlay
  - full-screen video
  - high-speed decode/render behavior

The example also registers console commands. Typical commands include:

- `play`
- `next`
- `prev`
- `pause`
- `resume`
- `stop`
- `seek <ms>`
- `vol <0-100>`
- `mute <0|1>`
- `ctrl <with_ui> <full_screen> <fullspeed>`

These commands allow you to experiment with UI visibility, playback state, fullscreen mode, and decode/render behavior without rebuilding the example.

### UI Features Demonstrated

The example view layer renders:

- play / pause state
- progress bar
- elapsed time
- current file name
- mute icon
- volume indicator
- FPS display

### Results

When the example runs correctly, you should see:

- playlist-based local video playback
- a status bar and center overlay UI
- overlay updates while playback continues
- console-controlled playback behavior

## Troubleshooting

### No media found

If playback does not start, verify that supported files exist in `/sdcard/render` or update `PLAYER_SOURCE_URL`.

### Unsupported file content

The example scans by extension, but the media still needs a decodable video stream. If a file opens but playback does not proceed, try another source file.

### UI missing or layout incorrect

Check display initialization and make sure the embedded font is included during build.
