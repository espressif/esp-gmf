# LDO Configuration
# This configuration sets up a LDO peripheral
# It is used to power external devices or peripherals
# Based on periph_ldo.py parsing script

- name: ldo_mipi
  type: ldo
  config:
    # LDO (Low-Dropout Regulator) configuration for power management
    ldo_cfg:
      # This is an hardware-specific configuration, please refer your SoC's datasheet for valid LDO channel IDs
      # You must specify a LDO channel ID manually, based on your board schematic.
      # e.g. For ESP32_P4, the valid values for chan_id are 1-4,
      # where channel 1 and channel 2 are respectively used for powering the internal Flash and PSRAM,
      # channels 3 and 4 can be used to power external devices
      # In P4 Function-EV Board, channel 3 is used for powering the MIPI phy
      chan_id: 3                     # [TO_BE_CONFIRMED] LDO channel ID

      # Output voltage in millivolts (default: 2500 for 2.5V)
      # Common values: equal to 3300 or between 500 to 2700, depending on device requirements
      voltage_mv: 2500                # [TO_BE_CONFIRMED] Output voltage in millivolts

      # Whether voltage is adjustable (default: 1 for true)
      # Valid values: 0 (fixed), 1 (adjustable)
      adjustable: 1

      # Hardware ownership flag (default: 0 for software control)
      # Valid values: 0 (software-controlled), 1 (hardware-controlled)
