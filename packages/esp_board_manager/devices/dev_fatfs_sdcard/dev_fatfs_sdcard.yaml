    # For SoCs where the SD power can be supplied both via an internal or external (e.g. on-board LDO) power supply.
    # When using specific IO pins (which can be used for ultra high-speed SDMMC) to connect to the SD card
    # and the internal LDO power supply, we need to initialize the power supply first.
    # This is an optional configuration, You can determine the available channel ID by checking the SoC datasheet.
    # whether it needs to be configured depends on your board.
    # Please check the schematic diagram or other documentation to determine if SDMMC is powered by LDO.
    # e.g., In ESP32-P4 Function-EV Board, VO4_LDO is connected to power the SDMMC IO. set it to 4 for VO4_LDO.
