# Example board_devices.yaml configuration for Power Control device
# This shows how to integrate the Power Control device into a board configuration
# All values shown are the actual default values from the device parser

# Example Power Control device with GPIO sub type configuration
- name: audio_power_ctrl          # The name of the device, must be unique
  type: power_ctrl                # The type of the device, must be unique
  sub_type: gpio                  # The sub type of the device, must be 'gpio' or 'ldo'
  peripherals:
    - name: gpio_power_audio      # GPIO peripheral name (must reference a GPIO peripheral)
      active_level: 1             # Active level (0-low, 1-high) when power is on

# Example usage in devices, add the power_ctrl_device attribute to the device configuration
# - name: audio_dac
#   chip: es8311
#   type: audio_codec
#   version: default
#   power_ctrl_device: audio_power_ctrl  # Reference to power control device
