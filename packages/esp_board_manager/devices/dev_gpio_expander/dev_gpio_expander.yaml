# Example board_devices.yaml configuration for IO expander device
# This shows how to integrate the IO expander device into a board configuration

devices:

  - name: gpio_expander                 # The name of the device, must be unique
    chip: tca9554                       # The chip of the IO expander
    type: gpio_expander                 # The type of the device, must be unique
    config:
      max_pins: 8                       # Maximum number of IO pins supported
      output_io_mask: [1, 2, 3]         # List of pins configured as output, maximum number is 32
      output_io_level_mask : [1, 1, 1]  # List of output levels for output pins (eg. set io 1,2 to high level, 3 to low level)
      default_level: 1                  # Default output level for output pins
      input_io_mask: NULL               # List of pins configured as input (NULL if unused), maximum number is 32
    peripherals:
